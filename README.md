## Project Background
The agricultural sector is highly sensitive to weather- and climate-related risks. Crop and livestock production can be significantly affected by the timing and intensity of rainfall, the frequency of very hot days, and the availability of water in the landscape. As such, the sector would greatly benefit from easy access to reliable, up-to-date information to support both short-term and seasonal planning and decision-making.

For short-term decisions, farmers need timely weather insights—such as rainfall over the past 10 days—to evaluate recent conditions and anticipate near-term risks. Likewise, supporting information on water availability, including surface water indices, can guide actions related to irrigation, grazing, and water resource use. Yet, such information is not always readily available to agricultural stakeholders in South Africa. It typically requires a high level of technical skill to extract from raw datasets and is not consistently operationalised or accessible in formats suited to end users.

This project addresses that gap by developing a web-based application that delivers weather and water availability information in the form of targeted indices tailored to agricultural needs. These indices are designed to simplify complex datasets and provide meaningful insights that can aid farmers and agricultural advisors in managing weather- and climate-related risks.

As part of the initiative, we conducted a review of existing weather, climate, and water information tools and identified indices most relevant to agricultural decision-making in the South African context. The resulting app provides a range of short-term historical and, where feasible, forecast indices related to weather risk and water availability. The interface is intentionally user-friendly, designed to support early warning, guide short-term monitoring, and enable timely, responsive decisions in the face of changing conditions.

Ultimately, the app serves as a national-scale resource to help agricultural users evaluate weather- and climate-related risks and distinguish between favourable and adverse conditions for farming across South Africa.


## Hydrometeorological indices app
More details about the app will be shared soon. In the meantime, please note that all supporting information and documentation related the app will be added to the App_manual folder: https://github.com/climindex/hydroclimsa/tree/main/App_manual

## Project contributors
This is a multi-institution project funded by the Water Research Commission (Project no. C2023/2024-01182). 

The forthcoming app is being developed by a researchers from the Agrometeorology and Water Science Divisions, along with developers at the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) as well as other collaborators. Special thanks go to Mr Philip Beukes, who served as the lead developer and played a central role in the design, implementation, and functionality of the platform. His contribution has been instrumental to the success of this tool. Alongside Dr Sarah Roffe, Dr Johan Malherbe, Dr Michael van der Laan and Dr Cindy Viviers made significant contributions to the inclusion of indices presented in the forthcoming app.
