## Project Background
Easy to access, up-to-date, user-tailored climate and water availability information (e.g., historical information on monthly frequency of very hot days in relation to streamflow levels) is extremely useful for decision-making for climate-sensitive sectors (e.g. agriculture and water resource management). However, due to the complexity in deriving such information from raw climate and water availability (e.g., rainfall, streamflow and dam levels) data, it is not always easily accessible for decision-makers who are involved in activities that are highly vulnerable to the risks of climate change and variability. Hence, the proposed research aims to support these decision-makers by developing a web-based tool to serve as an information and engagement platform of historical and forecast data on climate and water availability indices across South African water management areas. With national-scale application of this tool, it is intended that it complements early warning and forecasting systems to support long-term decision-making, management and monitoring for all South African climate-sensitive sectors. Overall, it is intended that the proposed app offers a simple means to aid in risk evaluation under climate change, and to discriminate between favourable and adverse conditions for the various climate-sensitive activities.

## Project Aims
1. To undertake a review on climate databank apps and climate and water availability indices relevant to climatesensitive activities (e.g. agriculture and water resource management) across South Africa.
2. To explore the relationships and linkages between climate and water availability indices and the impact thereof on agricultural production.
3. To develop a web-based smart app of climate and water availability indices relevant to climate-sensitive activities across South African water management areas.
